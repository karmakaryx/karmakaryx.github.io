					My MacBook suddenly died overnight for no reason.<br />
					It isn't turned on or off this morning. I can't hear the sound of the SSD, but the board is still warm.<br />
					I'm not even mad because I'm too flustered.ðŸ˜‚ What should I do?ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚<br />
					<br />
					I have to recover it somehow, but well.. que sera sera.ðŸ¤ª<br />
					<br />
					You suddenly made an unexpected visit to China.. All of sudden strange things keep happening.<br />
					Last time I noticed that you have no intention of visiting my country, so I don't have any expectation about your visit,<br />
					but if you stop by my country on your way home, let me buy you some yummy Korean food. The laptop is broken, so there's not much I can do for a while anyway.<br />
					(I probably wouldn't have written this if my laptop hadn't broken. I think China invited you to stop Tesla from entering India or you came to tease Dementia Joe, so it was supposed to be just a normal day for me..)<br />
					<br />
					I so panicked from this morning that I have nooooo idea tbh.ðŸ˜µ<br />
