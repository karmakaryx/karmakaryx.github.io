				I'm still having a hard time, Jack. It's not mentally difficult but the actual situation is bad in many ways.<br />
				There's nothing good news I can tell you, so I'm just saying nothing these days.<br />
				I'm afraid that it sounds complaints and because no one likes people who only talk about depressing things..<br />
				<br />
				It would be nothing for people like you, but for ordinary people, everyday life is so fragile and there's no escape even for the small unforeseen situation.<br />
				I want to talk about something specific why, but I think it will sound too lame and laughable for people like you, so I just erase it.<br />
				<br />
				If I don't come back too long, I might not exist in this world. I'm telling you in advance so you don't get me wrong.<br />
				You may think that no one ends their life with just these trivial things, but I'm very vulnerable now<br />
				because too many little shocks and damage have stacked up for too long and nothing good enough to forget them.<br />
				Now I don't have any will to try.<br />
				Someone said, "Even if you desperately climb up a cliff and barely take a breather, it's a moment to fall off again."<br />
				<br /><br />
				Can we meet someday if I get through these difficult situations and at least get back to peace..?<br />
