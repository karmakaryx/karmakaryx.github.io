					Me in 2014.<br />
					My sense of reality always tends to arrive in the future before others, so the perspective of people looking at social media in 2024 was exactly mine in 2014.<br />
					<br />
					What's interesting is that the king of social media, who allowed only celebrities who had the bluecheck or *influencers* with a lot of followers to have a selective conversation with him then, has realized this now.<br />
					He didn't seem to believe me no matter how many times I explained, "It's not a big deal for me to get tons of of followers and I have the ability whenever I want, but it doesn't matter to me and I don't care".<br />
					<br /><br />
					Seeing that he reposted this, I don't know if the fallen king is making excuses or if he's come back to his senses.<br />
					If you feel offended by the former, you could understand my frustration then.<br />
