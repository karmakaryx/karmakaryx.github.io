					I didn't give a shit about Coachella whateva because my life is on the edge of a cliff rn, but too many people are swearing at her show, so I had to check what happened later.<br />
					<br />
					? What technical issue? Do you think the public has no idea?<br />
					It's like a death sentence for DJs that the music stops during play. Your career as a DJ is over for good, fucking faker.<br />
					<br />
					You made terrible mistakes that even novice DJs don't make, and when you couldn't recover it, you just kept yelling out about irrelevant *math*. (What math, retard?) Is a loser that can't even do beatmatching can be called a DJ?<br />
					Did the bpm get faster? If you can't deal with such an unexpected situation, why on earth do you think a DJ is standing in front of the deck playing OTHER PEOPLE's music?<br />
					You hardly even do real-time mixing. You only care about bombastic gestures, shaking your faux claws. Do you think DJs are just staring into the deck so bored because they don't know how to dance?<br />
					I even had an accident where the player couldn't read my usb at all in the middle of the play because the deck was old. Still, I quickly changed the tracklist and finished my play all the way through. All the DJs do so.<br />
					<br />
					I heard you made the same bpm mistake in Mexico. It means you neither fixed the problem nor practiced. What are you?<br />
					Life is easy to you, isn't it? While the police visited my house three times to prevent my suicide today, you must be happy that life is soooo fucking easy, huh?<br />
					<br />
					SHE SHOULD NEVER BE ON STAGE NEXT WEEK. Coachella host should find the *REAL* DJ to replace her asap. She should not be DJing even at a rural cafe, let alone Coachella.<br />
					WHO TF INVITED SUCH A RETARD MORON TO THE BIG SHOW LIKE COACHELLA IN THE FIRST PLACE?<br />
					<br />
					As everyone is mocking and angry at her on the internet, it was the worst cringy, embarrassing stage I've ever seen, regardless of my personal dislike and contempt for her.<br />
					She had a similar accident in Japan and I noticed all of her endless mistakes then, but she blamed someone else for the catastrophic show.<br />
					Now it turns out it was HER LIE (as I already said) and she proved herself to be ineligible as a DJ.<br />
					<br />
					Not your fault? No, I swear as a DJ, it's 100% your fault.<br />
					If you're a DJ, I'm fucking Frankie Knuckles.<br />
					<br />
					It's a shameful disaster to be considered one of the worst train wreck and meltdown in Coachella history.<br />
					Shame, retard faker, shame.<br />
