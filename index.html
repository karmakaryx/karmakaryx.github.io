					Jack in his heyday had such an absurdly beautiful face beyond being handsome that I used to call it a masterpiece created when God was high, so it wasn't easy to find a movie star who was more handsome than Jack back then.<br />
					Still those screenshots are a visual shock.🤔<br />
					<br />
					But now, homele..😑<br />
					Appearance is also one of the most precious talents given by God, and for the sin of wasting God's special gift carelessly like now, Jack is likely to be born as a pillbug or a cicada in his next life.🙂‍↔️<br />

						Personal problems haven't been solved yet, but better than last weekend.<br />
						I really felt like the Grim Reaper kicked me off in front of the gate of hell, saying "Not your turn yet".<br />
						<br />
						Anyway it doesn't seem to be a good idea to talk about personal things anymore because no one worries about me here.<br />
						People don't want to hear dark stories, even if I say, it doesn't make any difference, because.<br />
						I'll be alive until I'm alive somehow, as long as I can find a place to breathe for a moment, I'll pretend to be pleasant and cool, mumbling 'Is there anyone living without a persona?'
						(But my persona is a little thicker..🙄)<br />
						<br />
						I've rarely seen anyone who has to live by doing everything solely alone without other's help like me.<br />
						Probably that's why it was so pissed me off to see someone who lives with endless free luck and opportunities.<br />
						Moreover, because it was the cruel weekend when I was so cornered.<br />
