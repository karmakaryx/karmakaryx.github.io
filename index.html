				A remote gift from the sun when you walk through the darkest dawn.<br />
				May this be the last tunnel of my life.<br />
			</p>
			<br /><br />
			I'm trying to survive somehow.<br />
			It is fortunate that I have learned the skill to read the transit of stars.<br />
			The myth that it is the darkest before the new lucky cycle begins is indeed true, like my Jupiter is stuck in the 12th house right now. Almost done.<br />
			After the Jupiter's care, Uranus, which has plagued me since 2018, will finally be heading to where it should be.<br />
			(I remember how wonderful and cool my life was when my sun's ruler was in its own place in my 20s.)<br />
			If the statistics I have personally accumulated and my long-time study for astrology are correct, I am now fighting the final test of my destiny.<br />
			I may be holding out desperately without committing suicide to prove the theory.<br />
			<br />
			Statistically, a lot of people commit suicide when their wheel of fate is at this point.<br />
			If you get over the final threshold, you can see the rainbow waiting. But so many people give up right before that.<br />
			We can't blame them. Getting over it isn't as easy as it sounds. There are cases where there is no way out at all in a realistic way.<br />
			Even I am having a very hard time finding the exit this time. Even though I know that I can meet a rainbow theoretically if I just endure one more month.<br />
			<br />
			But even if I can manage this crisis, I should not relax for a while. At least for a few months, I have to earn 10 million won a month.<br />
			I feel suffocated to think about it, but I thought I was really over this month.<br />
			All I can do is trust my own brain and God's gift. Last month, I used to earn a million won per day for a week in a row. I can do it.<br />
			<br />
			*<br />
			Aside from the money issue, all the data I've been learning and building for AI and other stuff for the last 6 months has been lost.<br />
			Apple technician said there was no way to recover my data. That's ok. It's just one of ðŸ’© happened to me recently.<br />
			It sucks, but I could start over again.<br />
			At least it doesn't make me die. I just felt like shit because I was slapped when I wanted to die.<br />
			<br />
			*<br />
			I don't know if the crazy bitch who moved in upstairs last month has moved out (as she said) or is just pretending.<br />
			Anyway her two ADHD kids aren't yelling and running around like crazy devils in this tiny studio this weekend. (Raising children in this small space is abuse, regardless of my pain.)<br />
			When there is a lot of work to be done and under too much stress, you are bothered and can't sleep by floor noise, the brain fuse is gone in an instant.<br />
			If guns were allowed in my country, that barbarian bitch would have been shot 30 times in the last month.<br />
			It is almost impossible to avoid floor noise in Seoul (It is one of the most serious social problems in my country as it's the cause of major murders.) but my ears are extremely sensitive by nature.<br />
			So I gave up a large space at the same cost and moved to a small place where young people with the same lifestyle as mine live.<br />
			In order to raise children, it's fair that she should go to a wider but old house. I would do so if I have children. People who don't want to make such sacrifices don't deserve to raise children.<br />
			Others are hell for the poor and I'm desparately praying to God that the new mover is sane.<br />
			<br />
			*<br />
			I didn't expect, but the medicine is working little by little.<br />
			I am a victim of the notorious humidifier disinfectant case of my country.<br />
			So, when microdust levels rise, breathing becomes very difficult.<br />
			However, because the exact cause is not identified in my case, I was officially registered as a victim but can't receive compensation.<br />
			To fight for that, I have recently been visiting one of the so-called Big5 hospitals in my country. It's the largest hospital I've ever been, holy shit, more luxurious than some kind of five-star hotel.<br />
			Because it's not a congenital disease, dozens of doctors couldn't find the cause of my status for the last decade, but some suspicious points were found after numerous tests and being treated.<br />
			Regardless of the compensation fight, there is some hope for a complete recovery now. Of course the huge hospital bills make it harder for me when I'm having a hard time with money.<br />
			But this level of testings and treatments would have cost millions of dollars if the United States. (I'm blessed?ðŸ˜‚)<br />
			<br /><br /><br />
			There is nothing as childish and meaningless as love in front of realistic problems.<br />
			I thought I was a loveholic, but love is not a priority anymore. Sounds cringy.<br />
			I have no time and energy to waste on people who are not directly related to my life. I hope they are happy and live well as always.<br />
			If I don't mention the two anymore and only talk about my sick and boring routine and personal things, they will naturally no longer visit my site either. Hope so.<br />
