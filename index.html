			Can we talk for a second, Jack?<br />
			<br />
			You may want me to say on Nostr,<br />
			but it's impossible to have a private conversation and delete the posts, you know..<br />
			I don't want to be seen because it's a personal matter.<br />
			<br />
			<a href="mailto:astrokaryx@gmail.com">astrokaryx@gmail.com</a><br />
			This is my email address, but if you want to talk in a more secure way, please send me the way by this email.<br />
			Even if it doesn't have your name on it, I'll be able to notice who the message is from.<br />
			<br />
			I don't mean to put you in trouble at all, so don't get me wrong.<br />
			If you feel uncomfortable, you can just ignore my request.<br />
			But I hope you don't look the other way this time.<br />
			Please.<br />
