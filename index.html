				<br />
				Happy Birthday, Elon!🫶<br />
				Why suddenly taking a video?<br />
				I just realize I've never posted a video of myself.<br />
				It's my first time taking a video of myself, eww, this is so cringe.<br />
				Hope you understand my poor pronounciations.<br />
				<br />
				Well, I'm not in this situation as I said.. And you!😡<br />
				Are you a baby hoarder?🤦‍♀️ Talk later.<br />
				(Cursing with eyes)<br />
				<br />
				Nonetheless, I just wanted to celebrate your birthday. That's all.<br />
				(This might be the last time I celebrate someone's birthday, bcos..)<br />
				<br />
				I hope you had the best day today (yesterday).<br />
				But you couldn't have because you're not with me.😛<br />
				<br />
				"가까이서 찍는게 더 잘 나오는거 같지 않냐?"<br />
				"나 좀 이상하게 찍히는거 같아. 카메라 이상해.."<br />
				<br />
				Now I'm gonna eat Elon!😆<br />
				Really yummy😋<br />
				<br /><br />

			I've found out why the screen felt a little weird while editing the clips.<br />
			I took the video with Snow app, but it seems like a filter or something was set up. Watch the cake move!😂🤣🤣🤣 Am I eating jelly?!🥹<br />
			<br />
			I don't know how to turn this effect off since I rarely take selfies.😑<br />
			But there's no big difference. If you wanna check if a romance scam 🤣, come see me directly.😉<br />
