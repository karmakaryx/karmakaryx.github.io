					Grimes is a fraud and her performance was trash. Engineer? Producer? Who?<br />
					Few musicians in electronic music scene don't mix and produce on their own. But she doesn't even mix her own (poor) songs. (It would be fair to say that she can't.) Then who's an engineer?<br />
					Are you talking about the con artist who exploits other people's talents and pretends to be her own?<br />
					<br />
					acid fairy whateva, if you don't know anything about music, especially electronic music, and you've barely heard anything other than Grimes, just say "I don't know about music well, but it wasn't that bad for my taste."<br />
					It's your problem that your taste is poor, but don't dare speak about a field you don't know anything about.<br />
					You're insulting all the other great talented musicians who didn't get a chance because of the con artist, that really makes me miserable and sad.<br />
					I'm aware that life isn't fair, and I've given up complaining about it but this has crossed the line.<br />
					Such an incompetent and even lazy fraud should never have any more chances.<br />
					Coachella is already a trashbin where some kind of k-pop idols shit take over (factory-made by abusing kids in the name of training like illegal circus acts) and real deals who love music lost interest in Coachella a long time ago except for pomo *influencers* who are crazy only about posting pics on Instagram.<br />
					Grimes turned it into food waste, not just waste.<br />
					Objectively saying, she wasn't qualified for Coachella "in 2024", but whose connections gave her such a ridiculous opportunity?<br />
					Jack, is that you? As long as I know, you either have something to do with Coachella or you're pretty close to the host.<br />
					If so, it's fair to exclude her next week. In the first place, she has never had enough activity to join the 2024 lineup. Of course musicans can apply themselves for festivals. Even so, she should have been rejected.<br />
					<br />
					I have more to say about this but I just got back from the hospital. Fortunately, the CT results were fine. But I don't want to live anymore.<br />
					Need to sleep for a while.. And I don't want to wake up again if possible.<br />
					<br />
					Actually, who cares? Why should I? All these things have nothing to do with my life and whatever happened during my life went to hell last weekend I didn't know at all and I didn't even have fucking time to give a shit.<br />
					The reason why I suddenly dropped by someone's account I quit was that my heart was so painful and my life is too tough that I just wanted to be comforted by anyone. However, I only got more stress in the end.<br />

					I didn't give a shit about Coachella whateva because my life is on the edge of a cliff rn, but too many people are swearing at her show, so I had to check what happened later.<br />
					<br />
					? What technical issue? Do you think the public has no idea?<br />
					It's like a death sentence for DJs that the music stops during play. Your career as a DJ is over for good, fucking faker.<br />
					<br />
					You made terrible mistakes that even novice DJs don't make, and when you couldn't recover it, you just kept yelling out about irrelevant *math*. (What math, retard?) Is a loser that can't even do beatmatching can be called a DJ?<br />
					Did the bpm get faster? If you can't deal with such an unexpected situation, why on earth do you think a DJ is standing in front of the deck playing OTHER PEOPLE's music?<br />
					You hardly even do real-time mixing. You only care about bombastic gestures, shaking your faux claws. Do you think DJs are just staring into the deck so bored because they don't know how to dance?<br />
					I even had an accident where the player couldn't read my usb at all in the middle of the play because the deck was old. Still, I quickly changed the tracklist and finished my play all the way through. All the DJs do so.<br />
					<br />
					I heard you made the same bpm mistake in Mexico. It means you neither fixed the problem nor practiced. What are you?<br />
					Life is easy to you, isn't it? While the police visited my house three times to prevent my suicide today, you must be happy that life is soooo fucking easy, huh?<br />
					<br />
					SHE SHOULD NEVER BE ON STAGE NEXT WEEK. Coachella host should find the *REAL* DJ to replace her asap. She should not be DJing even at a rural cafe, let alone Coachella.<br />
					WHO TF INVITED SUCH A RETARD MORON TO THE BIG SHOW LIKE COACHELLA IN THE FIRST PLACE?<br />
					<br />
					As everyone is mocking and angry at her on the internet, it was the worst cringy, embarrassing stage I've ever seen, regardless of my personal dislike and contempt for her.<br />
					She had a similar accident in Japan and I noticed all of her endless mistakes then, but she blamed someone else for the catastrophic show.<br />
					Now it turns out it was HER LIE (as I already said) and she proved herself to be ineligible as a DJ.<br />
					<br />
					Not your fault? No, I swear as a DJ, it's 100% your fault.<br />
					If you're a DJ, I'm fucking Frankie Knuckles.<br />
					<br />
					It's a shameful disaster to be considered one of the worst train wreck and meltdown in Coachella history.<br />
					Shame, retard faker, shame.<br />
