					Safe tripðŸ‘‹<br />
					<br />
					By the way, do you have any health problems?<br />
					There's no way you don't know such shoes are rude when you meet government officials in Asia. And the heels of the shoes look like medical ones, and your steps look a little weird.<br />
					I hope you're fine.<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					Now I have to figure out how to deal with this sudden laptop disaster..ðŸ˜¢<br />
					Whether the power is turned on or off, there should be any response on the screen to fix it!ðŸ˜© In this case, the only answer is to visit the service center..<br />
					I had ordered a super high-spec CTO because the main purpose of use was Logic, Final Cut, Motion. The price was over $4,000, so I can't even guess how much the repair will be charged..ðŸ˜©<br />
					<br />
					So many bad things are happening these days that it's annoying to explain. Nothing good happens, but only bad things happen, so I wanna quit all.ðŸ˜‚<br />
					Anyway, take care. :)<br />
